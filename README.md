#Problem Statement

We know that the small shop owners many times comes across the situation when the customer buys 
something and tells him to write it in his Khata. Instead of writing it on a paper we decided to 
make a solution in the form of our project named Credit-Info where the shopkeeper can note down 
is payables and recives in his Mobile where the name and number of the customer will be saved & 
how much money is to be given taken is also shown.

#Solution 

As the coming era is going to be entirely on Technology, so we thought of going technical which keeps the information of money payables and Received. 
The Credit-Info helps to solve the problem because It stores the Information of payables and Received money on the Application, so no need of writing it on the Paper.
We made an Android Application in language Java. For Storing the data we used Firebase. Android studio was used to build the Application.
